## Description
This planner application allows for one to plan their day accordingly with standard bussiness hours. The page's header displays a jumbotron that shows the current date and time so one never loses track of the day. The main content of the page shows the standard business hours displayed in time blocks where each hour has its own section to insert and save any text. The 'save' button saves all values typed into the input boxes so that all saved events are not erased. To remove or change any value in the input boxes, simply click the specific input box and type in a new event or delete the text to keep it blank.
